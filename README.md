# AlbNews

This repository contains Python code for reproducing the experiments with news headlines in Albanian presented in this [paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.04028). AlbNews is a topic modeling corpus of news headlines in Albanian, consisting of 600 topically labeled records and 2600 unlabeled records. Each labeled record includes a headline text and a label 'pol' for politics, 'cul' for culture, 'eco' for economy or 'spo' for sport. More details about the creation and the contents of AlbNews can be found [here](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.04028).
